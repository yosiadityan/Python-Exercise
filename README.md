# Python Exercise

This repository contains my set of solutions for Python exercises in [Exercism](https://exercism.io/). Each folder has different problems with its problem statement in the README.md file and test cases in a Python file ended with _test name. A solution is categorized as correct if it can pass all test cases. The solution is tested using the pytest Python package.

This repository will be updated regularly as I complete more problem statements in Exercism. ‚úåüèº
